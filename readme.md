# A11y exercises

## Why?
### My objective is to learn how to create accessible web content

## How?

### I begin from tutorials or exercises and I try to correct or adapt to learn more on web accessible devlopement using resources about accessibility, documentation or articles 

## Who?
### I learned the basics of development with the O'Clock school (August 2019- February 2020: 3 months basics (html, css, js, php...), 1 month Symfony, 1 month professional project + 1 month preparation of the professional title web and mobile web developer).

### The coronavirus changed all my plans afterwards but I started to learn more about digital accessibility and I know now that this is the way I want to go. 

### To teach myself I use many resources found on the web + I watch accounts on the subject on Twitter https://twitter.com/i/lists/1226802023858950144

### I also followed and obtained the W3C certification: Introduction to Web Accessibility. https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/foundations-course/
